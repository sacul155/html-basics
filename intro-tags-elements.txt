HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to define the structure and contents of a webpage.

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing tags.  They act as
containers for content.

HTML tags are essential building blocks that define the structure and content of a webpage.  Tags are basically the ends 
of an element that separates them from other elements.

This is the general format of an HTML element with opening and closing tags:
    <p> The p inside the opening tag denotes a paragraph element.  The closing tag is the same as the opening tag except
    we add a / to the beginning to differentiate it.</p>

Not all elements have a closing tag.  These are void elements, examples include:
    <img>
    <br>
