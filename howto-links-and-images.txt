Creating a link to a page in HTML is done using the <a> element, referred to as an anchor element.

To make a link actually navigate to the destination page, you have to add an attribute to the anchor opening tag.
    *Attributes give HTML elements additional information and ALWAYS goes in the element's opening tag.
    *Attributes are usually made up of two parts: a name and a value, but not all attributes need a value.
For a link, the name of the attribute used is href, or hypertext reference, and the value is the actual link URL.
So if you have some text in an HTML document that you want to link to a webpage, this is the format:
    <a href="URL">This is the text that will be highlighted blue.</a>

By default, the above method will open the link in the same tab that is currently open.  To change this, add the "target"
attribute to the opening anchor tag where you put the "href" attribute.  If the target value is "_self", it will open
the link in the same tab.  The value "_blank" will open the link in a new tab or browser.
    <a href="URL" target="_blank">Click here to open a new page</a>
There is also another attribute you can add to the opening anchor tag called "rel" which can take on the value
"noopener" or "norefferer".  The latter prevents certain details about the original page being passed to the new one.

Absolute links go to a webpage on a separate website, and relative links go a page on the same website.
Relative links do not need to include the URL since the page is on the same website.  Rather, it contains the file path
to the other page relative to the one you are currently on.  So if you want to create a link on the homepage to another
page on the website, the href attribute would look like this:
    <a href="./subdirectory1/subdirectory2">this is the link</a>.

To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element, which is void.  The "src" attribute tells us where the image is 
located.  If displaying images hosted on your own web server, you can use a relative path like so:
    <img src="./images/img1">
Images should also have an "alt" attribute describing what the image displays.

It's a good habit to always specify the image dimension with the attributes "height" and "width" like so:
    <img src="./images/img1" height="500" width="500">
