ALL HTML documents have the same structure, or boilerplate, that must be in place before anything gets done.

Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration, which tells the browser which version of HTML to render.  The latest
version is HTML5 and uses the following doctype:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
So every time a new HTML document is made, it must start with the doctype declaration.

Every document also needs a root element in which every other element is written inside of.  The root element looks like
this:
    <html lang="en">
    </html>
The syntax is similar to other non-void elements with an opening and closing tag, of which the type is html.
The word lang represents an HTML attribute given to an HTML tag.  lang specifies the language of the content on the HTML
page.

The next part of the boilerplate is the <head> element.  This contains metainformation about the webpage and stuff
required to make the webpage render correctly.  There should be no elements that are meant to display contents inside of 
the <head> element.  The structure of a <head> element looks like this:
    <head>
        <meta chartset="UTF-8">
        <title>"Webpage Name"</title>
    </head>
The <meta> tag with the chartset encoding should always be in the <head> element to ensure the webpage will display
special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.
The <title> element should also always be included in the <head> element of an HTML document.  The title is what is
displayed at the top of the browser page inside the tab.  Without a <title> element, it defaults to the name of the 
HTML file, which for an HTML homepage would be index.html.

The final part of the boilerplate is the <body> element.  This is where all displayed contents go, including text,
images, links, etc.  The structure of the body is as follows:
    <body>
        /*Insert content here*/
    </body>

Putting everything together, this is the full structure for the HTML boilerplate:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta chartset="UTF-8">
        <title>"Insert title here"</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>"Hello World!"</h1>
    </body>
</html>

In VS Code, you can shortcut the boilerplate by typing ! and hitting enter.  This only works for files with the .html
extension.
