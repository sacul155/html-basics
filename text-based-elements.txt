This section gives an overview of elements used to display text in HTML.

Paragraphs are written using the <p> element.  Each paragraph you want displayed needs to be wrapped in a separate pair
of opening and closing <p> tags.
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a separate paragraph.</p>

Headings are made using h followed by a number 1-6, like <h1>, which is the largest heading you can display.  Subsequent
numbers displayed increasingly smaller headings.
    <h1>I'm the biggest</h1>
    <h2>I'm second biggest</h2>
    <h3>Third</h3>
    <h4>Fourth</h4>
    <h5>Fifth</h5>
    <h6>I'm the smallest</h6>

The <strong> element makes text bold.  You can use this element inline with text that is inside another element.
    <p>This is how you make text <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
The <em> element italicizes text and works the same way as the <strong> element.

HTML comments can be used to write notes inside the HTML code while keeping it hidden on the actual webpage.
    <!-- This is a comment. -->

The following is an example of how to write a list in HTML using the <ul> element (bulleted) or <ol> element (numbered).
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
The items inside the <ul> element are the actual text being listed and are wrapped using the <li> element. An ordered
list follows the exact same layout, except you replace <ul> with <ol>.
